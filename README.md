# A-Hypothetical-World-of-Daisies
The aim of this short project is to create a simulation based on Lovelock and Watson's mathematical model (1983) of a hypothetical world containing only daisies. This will help us to understand the evolution of life and the planet's temperature as a result of simple feedback mechanisms.

# The Daisyworld Model
The Daisyworld model was created by James E. Lovelock and Andrew J. Watson in 1983 [1] to support Lovelock's earlier theory (1979) [2]: The Gaia hypothesis. The Gaia hypothesis states that Earth is a self-regulating system controlled by the interactions of the biota and the surrounding environment (atmosphere, ocean and land). Those interactions are an elaborate feedback system which maintains the conditions for life on Earth. The Daisyworld model is very simple and far from reflecting the complexity of real Earth, however it does help us to get some insight on how life on Earth contributed to stabilize
the climate. The objective is to and out whether steady states are reached despite the continuous forcing the planet is subjected to and if so, under which conditions it happens.
